        <p> <b>Cancer</b>  is a well-known disease entity in terms of associated morbidity and mortality.
          Despite of ever new researches and development of diagnostic and management tools, it is
          still a havoc. Cancer is not a single disease, actually it is a group of morbidities that affect
          every aspect of human life. It brings physical, mental, social and economical stress. It impairs
          the quality of life to a miserable extent. Even after aggressive treatment, it is difficult to control
          its progression, as the recurrences are common and inevitable. In Ayurveda, its causes,
          pathogenesis, prognosis, treatment etc. have been described.</p>

        <p style="color:green">A pilonidal sinus (PNS) is a small hole or tunnel in the skin. It may fill with fluid or pus, causing the formation of a cyst or abscess. It occurs in the cleft at the top of the buttocks. A pilonidal cyst usually contains hair, dirt, and debris. It can cause severe pain and can often become infected. If it becomes infected, it may ooze pus and blood and have a foul odor.</p>

<p>A healthy digestive system (Annavaha Srotas) is the key to good health.
  Digestive system diseases contribute a big proportion of all pathologies.</p> 
  <p>In Ayurveda, out of five types of Pitta Dosha, Pachaka Pitta (digestive fire) is
    primarily related to the digestion of food. After the action of digestive fire, Ahara
    Rasa (the food we take) is digested that results in formation and nourishment of all the
    tissues of body. Life depends on good food and good digestion of the same. A person
    having good digestive fire eventually has a good immunity and strength.</p>
  <p>It doesnot matter how much superior quality food we take, if it is not digested
    properly; it is worthless. As a result of poor digestion, Aama Dosha (toxins) is
    produced and accumulated in the body. This lead to manifestation of various diseases
    and metabolic disorders. Problems related to digestive system adversly affect multiple
    other systems of body and need to be addressed carefully. Ayurvedic treatment has
    its primary focus on strengthening digestive fire of the patient by way of Deepana
    and Pachana Chikista. Even after the procedures of Panchakarma, Deepana and
    Pachana Chikitsa is adopted for gradual strengthening of digestive fire and to pacify
    the residual vitiation of Dosha.</p>
  <p>There is a wide range of gastro-intestinal tract diseases like Irritable bowel
    syndrome, Constipation, diarrhoea, dysentary, acid-peptic diseases etc. In Ayurveda
    eight types of Udara Roga have been descibed in addition to other diseases pertaining
    to digestive system viz. Ajeerna, Trishna, Aruchi, Atisara, Grahani Roga, Visuchika,
    Alasaka etc. The entire treatment under the speciality of ‘Kayachikitsa’ is focussed on
    ‘Agni’ (fire) under which Shodhana (purification) and Shamana (pacification)
    Chikitsa (treatment) are employed to alleviate diseases.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center; margin: 10px; color: red;">Relation of Mental Stress on Digestive System</h3>
  <p>Gastro-intestinal system is
    innervated by Autonomic Nervous Sytem (ANS). It is comprised of Sympathetic and
    Parasympathetic Nervous systems. Emotional stress stimulates the Autonomic
    Nervous Sytem. If sympathetic system is fatigued &amp; parasympathetic system is over
    active, diarrhoea results. If sympathetic system is dominating and parasympathetic
    system is under-active, constipation occurs. In Ayurveda a holistic approach is
    adopted where both physical and mental causes are explored and treated. By Yoga
    practices mental stress, anxiety and depressive tendencises are dealt with.</p>

           <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Immunity Problems</h4>
           <p>Immunity Problems generally arise due to poor resistance towards various infections. Ayurveda aims at attaining and maintaining a healthy balance of Dosha (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), Dhatus (tissues of the body like blood, muscles and bones etc.) and Mala (faeces, urines, sweat, hair, nails etc.). Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Meda, Asthi, Majja and Shukra are the seven Dhatus. Oja has been stated as the supreme essence of all these Dhatus and is vital for good immunity and survival of the body. </p>
           <p>It is the matter of immunity that exposure to an infectious agent can result in manifestation of disease in one person, while the other person may remain healthy even after repeated such exposures. In our daily life, we see some people remain healthy throughout the year while some get very diseased quite oftenly. A mere change in season can precipitate an episode of illness. The difference is in the immunity levels. 

           </p>
           <p>Immunity is the inner strength that fights with diseases and keeps us healthy. In Ayurveda, various Rasayan therapies provide rejuvination and improve immunity levels. Rasayanas help in decreasing the pace of aging  and improve longivity and quality of life.  This is one of the most important preventive aspects, that Ayurveda has contributed to the service of humanity.

           <p>Who doesn’t want to look beautiful or handsome? But when it
            comes to shed the unnecessary fat from body, a holistic approach is
            required to get optimum results. Otherwise, one may suffer from various
            problems and discomforts to achieve the goals. Similarly a very lean and
            thin person is not appreciated as regards the physical looks and
            personality is concerned. To increase weight, people indulge in taking
            different artificially prepared chemicals, protein powders and even
            steroids. They loose both health and wealth in such efforts. </p>
           <p>Maintaining body weight with in healthy range is an ideal way not to improve your personality but also to minimise the chances of various disease. Unfortunately, overweight and obesity is the risk factor for a large number diseases viz. Diabetes (sugar), Hypertension (High Blood pressure), Thyroid disorders, infertility, musculoskeletal disorders like low back pain & osteo-arthritis and even cancer like breast cancer etc. An ideal Body Mass Index (BMI)  has been reported to range between 18.5 to 24.9. BMI is the index of body weight according to height of the person. A BMI below 18.5 suggests underweight and above 25 it suggests overweight.  

           </p>
           <p>Body weight management in Ayurveda is rational and free from adverse effects. It is primarily the Rasa Dhatu (Diet) which is responsible for  issues related to body weight. Srotas or the channels of circulation in the body play a vital role in nourisment of all the body tissues. In an obese person, these channels get blocked  resulting in accumulation of more n more fat in body while the other tissues are deprived of proper nourishment. As a result, a fatty person lacks actual physical strength. Similarly an underweight person is lacking good digestive fire or having blocked Srotas; so adequate nourishment and development  of tissues doesnot take palce.

          </p>
          <p>In Ayurveda, after proper consideration of various factors like Dosha, Dushya, Prakriti, Desha, Kala, Bala and Agni etc. regimens of diet, exercise and medicines are planned and prescribed. Individualistic yet holistic approach of Ayurveda is the best in managing body weight problems. A gradual and progressive approach helps in attaining and maintaining an ideal BMI by detoxing the channels of circulation.

           <h4 style="text-align: center;">Chronic Diseases and Metabolic Disorders</h4>
           <p>There is a cascade of chronic diseases and metabolic disorders with an ever increasing economic burden on society and country. Disease like Madhumeha (Diabetes mellitus), Hridya Roga (Hypertension and other Cardiovascular diseases), Shwasa Roga (Asthma), Harmonal disorders like Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism and metabolic disorders like Vatarakta (High serum uric acid levels) etc. account for major morbidity and mortality. The causes are primarily related to poor diet and life style habits. People have forgotten the right way of living. 
          </p>
           <p>Ayurveda is the science of healthy and happy life. It guides us the way to total health. Total  health is the combination of physical, mental, social and spiritual wellbeing. Lack of knowledge and awareness along with reluntance to adopt the principles of Ayurveda are detrimental to health. This is important to say that most of the causes are preventable. These days people believe in shortcuts. Fast food, no exercise, inadequate sleep, frequent use of machinary instead of manual work - all these are short cuts. Finally these shortcuts have cut shorted the health and length of life. 
 

           </p>
           <p>Chronic illness of any type requires a prolonged treatment. Some times it has to be continued life long. It is always better to adopt the treatment that is more natural and free from adverse effects. Otherwise, a treatment which is having adverse effects will lead to further health problems and the patient will be entanged in a web of different diseases and adverse effects of their treatment. Ayurveda has the potential of preventing and treating these chronic diseases. Ayurveda formulations are from natural sources that brings health in a natural way without adverse effects.

           <p>Healthy women is the foundation of a healthy family and
            society. She has to perform multiple duties in diverse capacities.
            In the present scenario, she has both indoor and outdoor
            responsibilities, amidst which she usually ignores issues related
            to her health. Low back pain, joint pains, leucorrhea (white
            discharge per vaginum), anaemia, menstrual irregularities,
            hormonal imbalances, PCOD, infertility and problems related to
            menopause etc; require special attention and approach. In
            Ayurveda all these health problems are addressed in a quite
            natural and simple way. For chronic and advanced problems, an
            extensive remedial approach is required. Simple health
            problems, if ignored, may result in serious illness enough to
            disturb the whole family.
          </p>
           <p>It is always advisable to seek advice
            from an expert in the very beginning to avoid the progress of the
            disease and its complications. These days, the cases of infertility
            are increasing due to multiple reasons like late marriages, less
            sperm count, hormonal disturbances, other health problems and
            so on. Proper investigation, counselling and treatment is
            required for successful outcomes.

           <p> <span style="font-size: 20px; color: red;">Skin Diseases &amp; Hair Problems</span>  are primarily the result of
            impurities in Rakta Dhatu (blood). Toxins circulating in the blood lead to
            manifestion of various problems like 18 types of Kushtha Roga, uneven
            skin tone, blemishes, moles, acne/pimples and skin allergies etc. Also,
            hair problems like early greying of hair, excessive hair fall and baldness
            are the common problems these days. Application of very costly creams,
            serums and oils usually fail to provide lasting improvement. Ayurveda
            works to root out the cause by natural ways and is devoid of harmful
            chemicals. Ayurvedic detox therapies purify blood and provide lasting

            is the specialized branch of Ayurveda that deals
with the diseases of children. Children have their own health problems
that need to be properly and carefully addressed. Ayurvedic health
formulations and tonics prepared from Indian Desi cow products and
natural herbal sources are best suited to the problems related to growth
and development. It is vital to maintain a good immunity status during
this age for the unhindered growth and development. A number of
diseases are particularly related to specific age group of children like
problems related to development, dentition and oral health and bed-
wetting etc. Malnutrition, recurrent infections, diarrhoea, indigestion,
eating problems and different psychological problems etc. require a
special approach. Healthy habits related to diet and life style are to be
inculcated since very early phase of life as it is their foundation of healthy
future life. Healthy youth is the future of a healthy nation as dreamed by
Swami Vivekananda.

better to prepare different food stuffs at home that are tasty and palatable.
Discourage all types of fast foods. If you are taking fastfoods in front of

        <p> <b><i>Ayurveda</i> </b>  is not only a medical science, it is actually the way of healthy and happy life. Ayurveda has a holistic and rational approach towards cure of diseases. <br>
        
          Diet and life style related diseases have an ever increasing graph pattern due to lack of awareness. Materialistic sophiscication is engulfing healthy routine practices and peace of mind. <br> <b>‘Prevention is always better than cure’ </b> especially when the resultant disease is either incurable or difficult to cure. Ayurveda has both preventive and curative aspects. Preventive aspect is very important specially when the disease is due to controllable risk factors. It becomes more important when there is a positive family history like different types of cancer including breast cancer, diabetes mellitus (sugar), hypertension (high blood pressure) etc. It is always wise to consult the doctor for preventive care. Diet according to season, daily practices of Yoga & Pranayama, maintaining body weight within healthy limits, regular detoxification of body by Panchakarma are the main preventive measures.   Proper awareness and healthy practices of Ayurveda can reverese the entire scenario. <br>
           Ayurvedic management is free from all adverse side effects. It increases vitality and quality of life. In Ayurveda, the management approach is totally individualized. <br><i>Consideration of Prakriti (psychosomatic constitution), Dosha (vital humors of body), Dushya (body tissues), Desha (location), Bala (physical and mental strength), Kala (season) and Agni (digestive fire) etc. are the main factors of  consideration while designing management.</i>  All these factors vary from patient to patient. Donot indulge in self medication, as it may not yield proper results. To obtain the best results, it is advisable to have consultation with an Ayurvedic expert.
